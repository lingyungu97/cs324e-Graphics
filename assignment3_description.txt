I choose Roboto-Black as the font because I thin this font looks nice. I use three colors including blue, green and teal because these colors are analogous colors and give a very pleasing feeling. I use font size of 20 because this size is large enough for people to see all the words easily and clearly while makes it possible to display a sufficient amount of words on the canvas.
